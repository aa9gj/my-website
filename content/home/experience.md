  Responsibilities include:
  
  * Informed bone mineral density (BMD) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by integrating splice quantitative trait loci (sQTL) data with Bayesian colocalization analysis. The results were further refined by using data from long-read RNAseq, and proteomics followed by experimental validation in-vitro. This enabled us to implicate causal genes in osteoporosis. 
  * Systematically identified long non-coding RNAs potentially responsible for the effect of BMD GWAS loci using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) Bayesian colocalization, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), and allelic imbalance analyses. Due to this work, we were able to shed light on the non-coding aspects of the bone transcriptome and their role in osteoporosis.
  * Characterized the landscape of isoforms and proteoforms in the process of osteoblast differentiation by combining long-read RNAseq data and proteomics data and applying differential expression analysis, differential splicing analysis, differential isoform usage, and other statistical approaches.

  description = """
  * Investigated human oral and gut microbiome community dynamics using both 16S and Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) metagenomics data analyses. This enabled us to understand host-microbiome interaction and provide detailed abundance counts at bacterial strain level resolution.
  * Implemented multiple bioinformatics pipelines and provided detailed instructions on their usage to assist lab partners and collaborators with their research needs.
  * Managed day-to-day laboratory operations including ordering, and Linux server maintenance.
  * Gained experience in the bash/Linux command line interface (CLI), Python, and R.
